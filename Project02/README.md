# Introduction:
Have you ever wondered how Netflix is able to guess what exactly you want to watch, or how Facebook manages to pull up your friends’<br>
posts that you have been eager to read? Oftentimes, these mind guessing tasks are translated into a recommendation problem<br>
in which items are ranked based on their relevance scores and the top items are suggested to the user.<br>
In this project, you will be implementing one of the most widely used social recommendation paradigms<br>
, called user-user collaborative filtering (well, a simple version of it).<br>
The intuition behind the algorithm is that users who have the same “taste” are likely to like to same set of things.<br>
With such an assumption, a recommendation system (a.k.a.recommender) could make a recommendation to a user by<br>
returning the list of items that other “similar” users have expressed their liking on. For example,<br>
you would see that Facebook often displays the posts that your friends “like” on your feed.<br>
In this project, you will be implementing a version of user-user collaborative filtering algorithm for recommending movies to users.
